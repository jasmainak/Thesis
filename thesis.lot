The table reports AUC ROC and AUC PR scores (higher is better) for each algorithms. The training time of each algorithm has been limited (for each experiment among the 10 performed for each dataset) to 30 minutes, where `NA' indicates that the algorithm could not finish training within the allowed time limit. In average on all the datasets, our proposed algorithm `OneClassRF' achieves both best AUC ROC and AUC PR scores (with LSAD for AUC ROC). It also achieves the lowest cumulative training time.\relax }}{158}{table.caption.61}
