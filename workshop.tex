When labels are available, classical criteria such as ROC or PR curves can be used to test the accuracy of an unsupervised algorithm. However, in lots of situations, too few or no data are labelized. This appeals to alternative criteria able to handle non-labelized data. In this paper, we present two criteria, the Excess-Mass and the Mass-Volume curves, which are empirically shown to be able to discriminate between algorithms as the ROC or PR curves do using labels.
