The training time of each algorithm has been limited (for each experiment among the 10 performed for each dataset) to 30 minutes, where `NA' indicates that the algorithm could not finish training within the allowed time limit. In average on all the datasets, our proposed algorithm `OneClassRF' achieves both best AUC ROC and AUC PR scores (with LSAD for AUC ROC).
